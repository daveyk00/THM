### How you redirect yourself to a secret page?

Look at the webpage,
```
Dear agents,

Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site.

From,
Agent R
```

No hidden text or anything in the source

Wappalyzer shows Apache 2.4.29, PHP and Ubuntu.

Go buster to look for other locations
`gobuster dir -u $target -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`


Modifying the useragent in Firefox, with a setting of `R` gives the message
```
What are you doing! Are you one of the 25 employees? If not, I going to report this incident

Dear agents,

Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```

`strings cute_alien.jpg` doesn't reveal anything interesting.
`strings cutie.png` reveals a couple at the end

Found something worth keeping!
PNG image data, 528 x 528, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced

So the zip file appears to be in the PNG file

`ls -la ./results/keepers`
returns
```

```

There is a PNG image file, an empty txt file, and a .zip file.
Zip file is password protected
`zip2john 8702.zip > 8702hash.txt`
`john --wordlist=/home/kali/rockyou.txt 8702hash.txt`
We get the results nearly immediately.

### steg password
From there open the zip file, read the .txt file

```
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R
```

Using Cyberchef to look at the password, it is base64 encoded `Area51`

Answer: `Area51`

### Who is the other agent (in full name)?

Using `stegoveritas` on the `cute-alien.jpg` there is an embedded `7z` file in it.  Extracting that it was empty.  Using `hexedit` on the file showed data, but no strings, and nothing that looked like a file format.

`steghide --info cute-alien.jpg` and providing it the `Area51` password showed a `message.txt`

`steghide --extract -sf cute-alien.jpg` and providing the password extracted the message.

```
