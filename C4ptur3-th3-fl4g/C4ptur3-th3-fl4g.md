# Task 2 Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

Using https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/download.html, open the file, and add a spectrogram

Answer: `Super Secret Message`

# Task 3 Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

### Decode the image to reveal the answer.

Answer: `SpaghettiSteg`

# Task 4 Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.
### Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

`binwalk meme.jpg`
we see there is binary file data in the jpg.
Extract it `binwalk -e meme.jpg`

We see a png file and a rar file.

Answer: `hackerchat.png`

### Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

Open the RAR file, extract the PNG file.
